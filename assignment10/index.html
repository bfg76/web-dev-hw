  Deep in the forests of the town of Oakvale, there lived a boy and his family. They had a lovely hamlet and were a happy family. <p>
     While the boy's mother, Scarlet, was off, his father, Brom, sent him to purchase a birthday gift for his sister, Theresa. The boy spent five gold pieces on a box of chocolates and went to the pumpkin patch to give them to Theresa. <p>
       Meeting his older sister at the pumpkin patch, the boy went to give her the chocolates, but they were interrupted.<p>
         Evil had come to Oakvale, as the boy and Theresa heard a cry of a man announcing that Bandits had come to pillage the town, before being brutally slaughtered before the children's eyes.<p>
           The boy took cover in the pumpkin patch and waited for hours until the screaming had stopped. When he left his hiding place, he saw his former home being burned to the ground, and in the middle of it was his father, murdered by the bandits for attempting to defend his family.<p>
             When he revealed himself, a bandit charged the boy, and mere moments before his blade met the boy's throat, he was struck down by a bright flash of light, and behind it was a wizard. A strange man who had come to save the boy. The wizard put a hand on the boy and they quickly left the village.<p>
               The Wizard introduced himself as Maze, and explained that he was taking the boy to the Heroe's Guild, an academy that had trained young men and women around the world to become the mightiest heroes across the land.<p>
                 Knowing the boy's want for revenge against the bandits, he enrolled the boy in the Heroe's Guild, and gave him a new name: AVATAR<p></body>
