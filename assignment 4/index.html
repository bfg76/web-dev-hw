<h1> How many, how much </h1>
<h2> Shel Silverstein </h2>
<body> <p>How many slams in an old screen door? Depends on how loud you shut it</p>
  <p> How many slices in a bread? Depends how thin you cut it</p>
  <p>How much good inside a day? Depends how good you live 'em</p>
  <p>How much love inside a friend? Depends how much you give 'em</p>
