                <h1><b><u>Here's how it happened</h1></b></u><p>
                  <h3>I was never a big sports guy growing up. As a matter of fact, I was the least into sports as you could be. I did soccer and baseball here and there, but never really liked it. This was my life.<p>
                    But it all came to change. When I began my sophomore year at Big Sky High School, my mother told me that I had to "play a sport or get a job".<p>
                      And she was right. I wasn't doing anything. I needed something that would have meaning.<p>
                        Now, mind you, I've always been a big kid. I am currently somewhere between 6'8" and 6'9", and by that time, I was probably about 6'5", and people noticed.<p>
                          The head football coach at Big Sky was one of my teachers, and he had been trying to get me on the team for a while, but I had tiptoed around it until the ultimanum that my mom gave me.<p>
                            So my sophomore year, without really wanting to, I signed up for football. I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW THE RULES AT THIS TIME, but I went out there. It went about as well as you could expect, I got my ass kicked every single day, being beaten by guys much stronger than me.<p>
                              But something came from it. A fire that I hadn't had before. I never played in a game that year, but watching my team succeed brought out the competitor and the teammate in me, and I thrived on watching my team win. By the end of the year, I told my coach that football was the best thing to ever happen to me.
                              <p> My junior year came and went faster than it seemed. I was bigger and stronger, but it wasn't doing me any good. I got my first and second concussions that year. I barely got any playing time that year, and missed half the season to injury. It was then that I swore I wouldn't let an injury keep me out again, because after watching my team win without me, I knew I needed to be in there.<p>
                                Then came my senior year, and before I knew it, I was thrown into the starting lineup. This was my shot and I needed to take it. I refused to let anything get in my way. The injury bug tried to take me again, I sprained and dislocated my ankle after being rolled up on in our first game, but I just put more tape on it and went back in after halftime.<p>
                                  During this season, I was exposed to something I thought would never be a possibility for me; college recruiting. I wasn't great in high school. No all-state honors, nothing. I talked to two college coaches after my senior year. The coach for Carroll College, who wanted me to walk on, and the coach for the University of Montana, who saw me as a diamond in the rough, and that if I really committed, could make something of myself, could be a D1 football player in time.<p>
                                    The opportunity to play for the Griz was too much to pass up, especially being a hometown kid, so I paid my own way to walk on.<p>
                                      The college world is so much faster than high school. Everyone was bigger, faster, and stronger than me, and I learned quickly to just shut up and work.<p>
                                        I had to deal with a coaching change, but due to depth issues, I was thrown into the fire in my first spring ball, and named a starter from there.<p>
                                          I continued to work to get bigger and stronger and better on and off the football field.
                                        Before I knew it, my first college game was here, and I got to run out of that legendary tunnel for the very first time.<p>
                                          The feeling was indescribable. Tens of thousands of fans cheering for us in a cloud of smoke, there is nothing like it. That was the day my football life really began, and all of those 5AM workouts and long practice sessions became so worth it. It's only up from here.<p></h3>
