  <body>I chose a guide on how to change a tire because I believe that it is an important skill that everyone should learn, and not all of us are fortunate enough to be able to learn such a skill young from our parents and there are way too many people out there who do not know how to properly change a tire. There are all sorts of places online to learn how to change a tire, and I just want to make it as easy as possible to do so or learn how to do so.</body>
