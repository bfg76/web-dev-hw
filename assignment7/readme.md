<h1>Assignment 7</h1>
<h2>Colton Keintz</h2>
1. Each of these codes are different ways of organizing different forms of video and audio. With each one describing a different form of the audio in its own way, formatting it differently.<p>
2. Alt text is the text equivalent for an image. When looking at a raw file that has an image in the code, there is certain text that indicates all of the properties of an image.<p>
3. This assignment was difficult, and time consuming. I enjoyed it, but it is confusing and frustrating to see my projects work perfectly in the previews but not in the actual thing, and that led to some anxiety when finishing this project.
