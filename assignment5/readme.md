1. While you can only have one head element, you can have as many body elements as you need. That being said, you can only have one HEAD element, but you can break your headings down into h1, h2, h3, etc. and in that case, you can have more than one.
2. Semantic markup is meant to use the text as it literally implies. For example, assuming that any text located under an h1 heading is more important and should be studied thoroughly because it was put first, while Structural Markup is looking at the text in the order that it appears
3. I had fun with this assignment, because the hash brown casserole is one of my favorite foods, and if done right, will absolutely change your life. I love getting to discuss food, I really enjoy cooking and want to share it with everyone. This project was very time consuming, but definitely worth it.
