1. I learned a lot about web development, especially how timely of a process it is! A lot of patience and frustration went into these projects, but it gave me a huge level of respect for people who do this for a living.<p>
2. There are a lot of ways to make a page your own! I had no idea the ways you could decorate a page to be unique to you!<p>
3. I think this might be the project I'm most proud of. This is a topic I'm passionate about because of the long journey it took to get where I am. I had to earn everything I have now, and it was never easy. I didn't make this to brag. I believe it is a good story that people can learn from.
