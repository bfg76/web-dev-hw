<p>1. I visited an old person of Amazon.com from 2005, and it amazed me how different it looked back then. Nowadays, amazon is very smooth, aesthetically pleasing and is able to run across all sorts of devices, but back then, it was very blocky and formal, and the text was very small. It just seemed too busy, there was less organization.</p>
<p>2. The GIT website is still a bit complicated to me. I was having trouble getting it started, and eventually I just went back to using the github.com website to organize everything, because I knew more about how it worked and was able to run everything smoother than trying to learn a new thing on the fly.</p>
