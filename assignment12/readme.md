# Assignment 12
## Colton Keintz
1. My imaginary client was a film company that I am a part of. DAZMO Films is a small studio here in town and we make and upload everything ourselves. <p>
2. These are different ways of formatting text, and placing them in different areas on the page. <p>
3. This was a fun assignment to make because I got to make something that is real to me. DAZMO means a lot to me and I love to talk about it, and this was just another opportunity to do so.
