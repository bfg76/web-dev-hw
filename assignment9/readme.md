1. These selector types are used to cover different areas of a document and the universal one is more adaptable to several areas.
2. I selected gold, black, and white because I believe that they have a certain authenticity when it comes to the 1950s. It was a movement of individuality and an age where Rock and Roll music was taking the stage, and brought its loud, boisterous personality and color palettes with it.
3. I had to submit this assignment out of order because it was getting frustrating to me because I couldn't get my pictures to show up and the background the color that I wanted. I think it turned out fine, but it was a long process
