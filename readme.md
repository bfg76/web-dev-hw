# Assignment 2
## Colton Keintz
I decided to take this class because, as a Media Arts/Digital Filmmaking major, I want to be able to demonstrate proficiency in multiple aspects of online media management, because the world of film is becoming more and more reliant on computers, and the best films of this decade have ample amounts of CGI, and we would be nowhere without the advances that we have made in the past few decades in terms of technology in film. I hope to make a career in filmmaking someday, and I believe that this class is a step towards that.

I hope to learn how to manage a web page, explore new forms of web design, and add to my media arts skillset
