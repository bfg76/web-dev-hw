   <h5>Never fear! This super simple process will show you how to remove the flat and replace it with a fresh tire in a jiffy!</h5> <p>
     <h5> Step 1: Make sure you have everything you need</h5><p>
     It's a great idea to come prepared with a lug wrench in your car, and many models come with a preinstalled spare tire and jack under the rug in the trunk.

       <h5>Step 2: Set the jack under the car</h5><p>
         ![jack](./images/jack.jpg)<p>
          Place the jack securely under the car. The proper places to place the jack vary between car models, consult the owner's manual for the proper place to set the jack. Depending on the type of jack, you may need to either crank or pump the jack. Continue to do so until the car is about 6in. off the ground.<p>
            <h5> Step 3: Use the Lug Wrench to remove the lug nuts. </h5><p>
              ![Lug Wrench](./images/wrench.jpg)<p>
                Use the lug wrench to remove the five or six lug nuts from the center of the wheel. Remove the nuts in a star pattern like so.<p>
                  ![guide](./images/guide.jpg)<p>
                    Removing the nuts in this fashion prevents wheel denting and scraping. After this is done, pull the flat tire off of the wheel. <p>
                      <h5>Step 4: Load the spare tire onto the wheel</h5><p>
                        Now you will place the spare tire onto the wheel in the same way that you took off the spare. Lift it to the wheel and press it firmly around the metal. Tires can be heavy, so get assistance if you need.<p>
                          <h5>Step 5: Attach the lug nuts back on to the wheel</h5><p>
                            Now you will put the lug nuts back onto the tire. It is important to put them on in a star pattern just as you did when you removed them (see the diagram above if needed.) Place each lug nut on by hand to make sure it is straight, and tighten it as much as you can by hand, do not use the lug wrench yet. <p>
                              <h5>Step 6: Lower the vehicle and secure the lug nuts</h5><p>
                                Lower the vehicle off of the jack and to the ground carefully and remove the jack from under the vehicle. Once the vehicle is secure, use the lug wrench and, following the star pattern, tighten each lug nut until it will not turn anymore. DO NOT TURN THE WRENCH if the lug nut will not turn, as this will ruin the nut.<p>
                                  <h5>Step 7: Get to an auto shop as soon as possible</h5><p>
                                    You've got a tire on! Pack up all of your materials and continue on. Note that spare tires have less durability and are typically smaller than regular tires, and are not a permanent solution. Get to an auto shop as soon as you can to get a new tire put in place.
