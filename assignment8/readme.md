# Assignment 8
## Colton Keintz
1. HTML was at first very confusing, and everything went slow, but as I began to work on the assignments more and more, it got a lot smoother, and a lot easier to practice repetition. so I think it has been a very worthwhile skill to learn.<p>
2. I just want to make my codes look smoother. I know that I'm just starting, but I feel that my work could look prettier. <p>
3. It was a lot of work to get everything in place, and it took a couple of days to make sure I had everything the way I wanted. It was pretty easy to get everything there, but making it sound good and be the way I wanted took some time.
