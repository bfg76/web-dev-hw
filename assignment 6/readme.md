<h1>Assignment 6</h1>

<p>1. Being an avid videogamer, I have come across login forms of all types, which ask for all sorts of information before they allow me to play. Their biggest purposes are gathering all sorts of information for potential new users and retaining that information for returning users</p>
<p>2. An example from question 1 would be a login prompt in terms of text and button inputs. For most, if not all forms of online login, you have to input a username and/or an email address, along with a password you created. These can be used on websites for videogames, project building, medical help, etc. Github is one such site that uses login prompts</p>
<p>3. This was a challenging assignment, mainly because it took such a long time. The index was a long process to get it just right, and while I know I could still improve upon it, I'm proud of what came out.
