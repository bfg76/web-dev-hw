1. These fonts are used for different purposes, with web-safe fonts being the simplest to apply and add to your projects.<p>
2. Fallback fonts are a safe measure in case the font that you want doesn't show up for whatever reason. Applying a fallback font will put in a backup font that won't be used unless your primary font fails.
3. This was a tough project. This stuff is starting to get really hard. It took a lot of work just to make the font the color that I want, and I wish the background picture would cover the whole page rather than just repeating.
